Welcome to my CV; **Operation Job**.

## User Story
```
As Joe
I want to create my CV as a webpage
So my CV stands out, especially for a software developer position
And I can show some actual code to potential employeers
And I can show other skills I have
And I can have more fun than making a typical CV
```

## Goals

* To have clean, well documented and unit tested code.
* To integrate video and photos thoughout.
* To continue to develop code so I can keep my skills up even though I am unemployed.


Ultimately I hope I find an **epic** company to work for that would benefit from all my skills.

#### Note this is currently a work in progress but I am open to any feedback.
