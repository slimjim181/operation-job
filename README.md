## User Story
```
As Joe
I want to create my CV as a webpage
So my CV stands out, especially for a software developer position
And I can show some actual code to potential employers
And I can show other skills I have
And I can have more fun than making a typical CV
```

## Goals
* To have clean, well-documented and unit tested code.
* Integrate video and photos throughout.
* Responsive design.

Ultimately, I hope I find an **epic** company to work for that would benefit from all my skills.

## Supported Browsers
I assume that most potential employers will view my CV on a desktop or laptop computer. But I built with responsiveness in mind to show my skills.
I only have access to my phone; a Sony Xperia Z2 (Android 6.0.1) for mobile testing so hopefully it works on iOS but I have no way of knowing for sure.

## Report
After ~50 hours work on this code I thought I might write down a bit of a retrospective on my efforts. Overall I am quite happy with my work but I have a few things I would do differently next time.

### Single Page App
I wanted to build a single page app to show my knowledge of react state but in terms of the user experience it just does not feel right when refreshing the page puts you back to the home page.
Maybe at a later date I might add in a web router.

### CSS Pre-processors
Normally I work with Scss not straight css but I wanted to use just css this time to see the difference. I wish I did stick with scss!
